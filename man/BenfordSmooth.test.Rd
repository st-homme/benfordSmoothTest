\title{Compute the family of smooth goodness-of-fit test statistics {T_k, k = 1, Kmax} ( 1 <= Kmax <=  7 )
 and T_K-hat (the data-driven version) for the null hypothesis of a Newcomb-Benford distribution.}
\usage{
BenfordSmooth.test(data, Kmax = 5, MC_replication = 5000)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data vector of integers  {1,2,â€¦,9}. Otherwise, the first significant digit is considered}

\item{Kmax}{integer between 1 and 7: default = 5}

\item{MC_replication}{Number of Monte Carlo replication to compute the p-values: default = 5000}
}
\value{
The function returns the values of the tests statistics in the family of test statistics {T_k, k = 1, Kmax}
and the data-driven smooth test  T_K-hat
as well as their p-values (Monte carlo if n <= 100, asymptotic chi-square otherwise).
