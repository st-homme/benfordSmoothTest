Description: Compute the family of smooth goodness-of-fit test statistics {T_k, k = 1,..., Kmax} (1 <= Kmax <= 7) and T_K-hat (data-driven) for the null hypothesis of a Newcomb-Benford distribution. The p-values are computed by Monte-Carlo resampling (if n <= 100; by default 5000 Monte-Carlo replications), and using the asymptotic chi-square distribution otherwise. See  http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00520 for details. The data is expected to be a set of integers in {1,2,â€¦,9}, otherwise the first significant digit of each data value is extracted and use for the test.
